# Global metatable

Easy access to global variables across your system. Values are saved into the database. Currently only lua tables are supported.

Usually you should use this table to share values across requests.

- [global:set(key, value)](#set)
- [global:get(key)](#get)
- [global:delete(key)](#delete)

# set

Saves a global value into the database. You need to provide a key and a table to be saved. If the key already exists it will be updated.

```lua
local data = {}
data.Test = 10

global:set("Test", data)
```

# get

Retrieves a global value from the database. You need to provide a key. If the key does not exist this method will return nil.

```lua
local data = global:get("Test")
--- data.Test = 10
```

```lua
local data = global:get("NoExists")
--- data = nil
```

# delete

Deletes a global value from the database. You need to provide a key. If the key does not exist nothing will happen.

```lua
global:delete("Test")

local data = global:get("Test")
--- data = nil
```
